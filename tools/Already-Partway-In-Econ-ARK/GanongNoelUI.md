## Peter Ganong and Pascal Noel

This paper is already instantiated in a [REMARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK/master/blob/REMARKs/GanongNoelUI.md).

However, that REMARK contains a number of tools that would be very useful as standalone classes or other objects 
in HARK. For example, there is a naive hyperbolic discounting tool.
