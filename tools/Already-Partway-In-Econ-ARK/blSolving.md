# "[Solving heterogeneous agent models in discrete time with many idiosyncratic states by perturbation methods](https://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=13071)"
## by Christian Bayer and Ralph Luetticke

This paper introduces a set of tools that build on Michael Reiter's previous work to provide a method for rapidly solving and simulating
Heterogeneous Agent macro models.

At this writing (2019-04-06), python code for solving the model is [on the "BayerLuetticke" branch](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/tree/BayerLuetticke/HARK/BayerLuetticke) of HARK.

For current status, see the [README.md](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/tree/BayerLuetticke/HARK/BayerLuetticke/README.md) there.
