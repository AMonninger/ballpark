    "This paper develops a two agent model with endogenous default to  analyze how the income distribution may affect household leverage and the likelihood of financial crises. \n",
    "\n",
    "Main Findings: \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) An increase in the income share of high-income households leads to an increase in household leverage as wealthy households, due to their preferences for wealth, recycle part of their income back to the other households along the income distribution in the form of loans/bonds. \n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) A rise in household leverage leads to an increase in the probability of financial crises as the benefit of defaulting rises without affecting the costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) The deleveraging that occurs after a crises is only temporary. Over time, household leverage returns to its original pre-crises level due to an increase in the income share of high income households that resulted from the crisis."
