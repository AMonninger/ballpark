    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper employs a benchmark heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic model to examine a number\n",
    "of plausible drivers of the rise in wealth inequality in the U.S. over the last forty years. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main findings are as follows:\n",
    "* The significant drop in tax progressivity starting in the late 1970s is the most important driver of the increase in wealth inequality since then \n",
    "* The sharp observed increases in earnings inequality and the falling labor share over the recent decades fall far short of accounting for the data \n",
    "* Returns on assets matter to account for the dynamics of wealth inequality over the period as portfolios of households differ systematically both across and within wealth groups\n"

    "#### A Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari model\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper uses a macroeconomic general-equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents—the Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari setting—to examine more closely a set of candidate explanations for the increase in U.S. wealth inequality over the last forty or so years. The method the authors follow is thus to: \n",
    "* (i) independently measure changes in the environment, such as in the tax code, the earnings processes facing individuals, and their portfolio returns; \n",
    "* (ii) feed these into the model assuming that the economy is in a steady state in 1967; \n",
    "* (iii) examine the resulting wealth distribution path; and \n",
    "* (iv) conduct counterfactuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Portfolio heterogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, the authors depart from the benchmark model by introducing portfolio heterogeneity across and within wealth groups. This is motivated by the fact that register data in Norway and Sweden (see Fagereng et al. (2015) and Bach et al. (2015)) have revealed, first, an average return that is increasing in the household’s overall level of wealth; and, second, an idiosyncratic return component (because different households hold different types of assets) whose variance is also increasing in wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major finding is that, once portfolio heterogeneity, calibrated to the findings in Bach et al. (2015), is incorporated into the model, the authors replicate wealth inequality of the magnitude we see in the data. Given the role of portfolio heterogeneity and of asset-price movements, it is important to think more about the origins of these observations. This paper is an important step forward in noting just how important portfolios and asset prices are for inequality.\n"

Overall, differences in mean returns across wealth levels are far more important, though at the very top idiosyncratic return risk matters equally.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Declining tax progressivity, together with increasing earnings risk and higher earnings inequality amongst top earnings, can account for the rise in the capital-to-net-output ratio and at least some of the decline in the (gross) labor share when the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is larger than one as in Karabarbounis & Neiman (2014b). This model thus provides an alternative to the central mechanism—declining growth rates—to which Piketty (2014) draws attention in attempting to connect these macroeconomic trends to rising inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the key mechanism accounting for dynamics lies in heterogeneous portfolios across and within wealth groups, along with systematic return movements in the data."
