    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "- The paper finds a way to match stock market participation rates and asset allocation decisions conditional on participation, by using a life-cycle model with uninsurable labor income risk and moderate risk aversion, where the labor income risk is **idiosyncratic** and the degree of risk aversion is **heterogenous**. \n",
    "- They found that households with low risk aversion smooth earnings shocks with a small buffer stock of assets, and consequently most of them never invest in equities. Endogenously, stockholders are more risk averse, but they still do not invest their portfolios fully in stocks."

    "\n",
    "- In most industrialized countries, stock market participation rates have increased substantially. A large share of population, however, still do not own stocks either directly or indirectly (through pension funds etc.) \n",
    "> In U.S., the stock market participation rate is close to 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even for those households who do own stocks, a significant proportion of their portfilios are not in stock. \n",
    "> Conditional on stock market participation, the average equity holdings as a share of financial wealth for stock market participation is 54.8%\n",
    "\n",
    "- Participation rate goes up during working life and might go down during retirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no clear pattern of equity holdings over the life cycle. "

    "\n",
    "- The key feature making the model fit the empirical evidence (low stock market participation rate and the low share of investment in stock market conditional on participation) well is Epstein-Zin utility function. This specific utility function makes it possible that the degree of risk aversion is unrelated with elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Due to the separability of risk aversion and EIS, the assumption that the population is composed of two groups (a group with low risk aversion and low EIS, and a group with high risk aversion and high EIS) leads to the result that people who enter the stock market are **endougously** more risk averse and thus not investing all their portfolio into the stock market. \n",
    "\n",
    "- However, the underlying reason why this utility form is reasonable to accomodate data is absent. "
