# 'In the ballpark' of the Econ-ARK ...

means papers or models that are closely related enough to be of interest to the kinds of people who are interested in the Econ-ARK.

These are papers that an ambitious graduate student might be able to turn into a course project in an advanced class in structural microeconomics, heterogeneous agent macroeconomics, or computational economics. 

The papers mentioned here are of two kinds: Papers that
1. Have serious structural models that produce interesting results
   * In the "models" directory
   * The objective: Replicate (or improve!) the quantitative theory
1. Have strong empirical evidence that begs for a model
   * In the "empirical" directory
   * The objective: Construct a model that speaks to the results

We will be delighted to post any such contributions, under the name of the contributor, in:
   * The [REMARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK) repo 
      * if it is substantially complete replication of the paper's results
   * The [DemARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/DemARK) repofLyMd-mAkEr
      * if it demonstrates some of the ideas or content of the paper 

As an example of the kinds of things we are looking for, see the [paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6052/a3eff6257db799e5e54ee0e99a358b11bccf.pdf)  by Iskhakov et al cited below, which is instantiated in the Econ-ARK ecosystem in four ways, in increasing order of importance, in the Econ-ARK:

1. As an entry in [our public Zotero bibliographical database](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2314611/ballpark)
1. As a DemARK at 
1. As a REMARK at 
1. As a collection of tools under the name `DCEGM`
    * `from HARK.DCEGM import *`

The papers listed herein are a small subset of the ones that we would welcome into the Econ-ARK. If you want to work on a paper that is not listed here, post an "issue" on the repo asking (and providing a link and bibliographical reference for the paper in question). If it is likely to prove interesting to our audience, we are very likely to encourage you to replicate it.
